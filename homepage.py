st.write("""<p>In the UNSCon we present a new framework for annotating expressions of Conflicts, used on examples of 
debates on Ukraine crisis from 2014 and two debates on Women, Peace and Security Agenda. 
Conflicts are defined as a form of critique or distancing oneself from the positions or actions from another 
country present at the Council. A Conflict in our guidelines is therefore not necessarily a report of a military conflict - 
generally, this is a verbal Conflict expressing a negative evaluation. </p>
<p>A Conflict consists of a <b>Target</b>, which is the entity being evaluated, and a negative evaluation toward that Target. 
The holder of the evaluation is always the <b>Speaker</b>.</p>
<p>Conflicts can be expressed by directly criticizing the country (<b>Direct Conflict</b>) or indirectly by addressing 
the critique to a surrogate entity (<b>Indirect Conflict</b>). Next to Conflicts being defined as a negative 
evaluation of a Target, we look at <b>Challenging</b> Statements accusing the Target of not telling the truth, as well as the 
Correction of that allegedly false statement.</p>""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
